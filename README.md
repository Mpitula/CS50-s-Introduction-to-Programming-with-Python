# CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python

Welcome to my GitHub repository for **CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python**! 🎓🐍

This repository contains my weekly submissions for the course's problem sets. The course is offered by [Harvard University](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/) and is designed to provide a strong foundation in programming using Python.

## 📚 About the Course

CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python teaches the basics of programming and computer science using the Python programming language. Topics include:

- Functions
- Variables and Types
- Conditionals
- Loops
- File I/O
- Libraries
- Unit Testing
- Exceptions
- Object-Oriented Programming

✅ Completed problem sets are committed weekly as I progress through the course.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **VS Code**
- **GitHub**
- **CS50’s Python Checker Tools**

## 🚀 Getting Started
